## What is it?

**generate-nft** is a Python package that creates multiple random mutations of a given picture without needing to feed separate layers of the image. Just provide one image and it can generate multiple variants of that image quickly. 

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that generate-nft does internally:

  - Split the given image into mutliple color channels - RGB, RGBA etc.. 
  - Mix and match these color channels randomly to create unique images 
  - Creates random background images to make it more unique
